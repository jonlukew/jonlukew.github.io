# Software and Available Linux Alternatives
In an attempt to be able to change to Linux permanently, alternatives can be required for certain applications that have not been ported to Linux yet.

Keep in mind that a lot of the applications listed are also available via [Flatpak/Flathub](https://flathub.org/en) or the [Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/store), or as packages built into various Linux distro repositories (this is usually the recommended installation method if it is available).

If a given software is missing from this list it is either: a) Not available on Linux, b) I don't know about an appropriate alternative or c) I haven't heard of the original software.
